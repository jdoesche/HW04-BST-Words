So.
Basically.
This contains issues that need to be sorted out.

1.) Segmentation Fault when Printing after overwriting an already existing number
    RESOLVED
2.) Segmentation Fault when Printing after reading in files
    RESOLVED
3.) Segmentation Fault when Printing after deleting an entry

All of these issues are related to printing... so what's going on?
  It may help to know that the replaced item was never added
